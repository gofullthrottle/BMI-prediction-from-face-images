# Body Mass Index(BMI) prediction from face images

The human face can be used to extract plenty of information and researches have been made to predict the body mass index based on facial features too. We tend to follow the research studied in our [reference paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885613000462) to predict the BMI and possibly suggest a diet based on the predicted BMI.
