Following features must be extarcted from facial images in order to predict the Body Mass Index


cheekbone to jaw width (CJWR), 
			Cheekbone width   = P1 to P15
			Jaw width 		  = P4 to P12
			CJWR = |distancce(P1 to p15)| / |distance(P4 to P12)|


width to upper facial height ratio (WHR),
			Cheekbone width   = P1 to P15
			Upper facial height = P67 to N1	



perimeter to area ratio (PAR),
			Perimeter(P1 P4 P8 P12 P15 P1 )/Area(P1 P4 P8 P12 P15 P1 )



eye size (ES), 
		average distance between P28 and P33 minus the distance between P30 and P35 .
		
		formula = 1/2(|P28 P33| - |P30 P35|)


lower face to face height ratio (LF/FH),
			Lower face height LFH = dist(P1 to P8)
			Face Height = |N2 to P8|
			ration = LFH / FH


face width to lower face height ratio (FW/LFH), 
			Lower face height LFH = dist(P1 to P8)
			Face width =   |P1to P15|
			Ration  =  FW / LFH


mean of eyebrow height (MEH).
			distances = distances between P22 to P28 ,N3 to P29 , P30 to P25 , P19 to P35 , N4 to P34 , and P16 to P33
			1/6 (sum (distances))
